The Moon, Earth’s only natural satellite, orbits our planet at an average distance of about 384,400 kilometers. It is roughly one-fourth the size of Earth and is the fifth largest moon in our solar system. Scientists believe it formed around 4.5 billion years ago, shortly after Earth itself, as a result of a colossal collision between the early Earth and a Mars-sized body known as Theia. The debris from this impact eventually coalesced to form the Moon. This theory explains why the Moon’s composition is so similar to Earth's outer layers.

The Moon exerts a powerful influence on our planet. Its gravitational pull is the main force responsible for the rhythmic rise and fall of ocean tides. Beyond that, the Moon also helps stabilize Earth’s axial tilt, preventing extreme changes in climate over long periods. Without the Moon, our planet might wobble unpredictably, leading to chaotic weather and environmental conditions. Its synchronous rotation means the same side of the Moon always faces Earth, which is why the far side — sometimes called the "dark side" — remained mysterious until space missions revealed its rugged terrain.

Though the Moon appears lifeless, it holds immense scientific value. Its surface is covered in a fine dust called regolith, created by billions of years of meteor impacts. Some of its craters, especially near the poles, contain ice trapped in perpetual shadow — a potential resource for future astronauts. Today, missions like NASA’s Artemis program and various international efforts are preparing to return humans to the Moon, not just for exploration but to establish a long-term presence. This renewed interest marks a new chapter in space exploration, where the Moon serves as both a testing ground and a launch point for journeys deeper into the solar system, including Mars.
